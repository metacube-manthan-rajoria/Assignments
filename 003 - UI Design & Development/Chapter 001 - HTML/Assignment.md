# Problem Statement

### NOTE
Only the HTML part is required for this assignment. No need to focus on achieving the same styling as depicted in images etc.
- Selection of tags is a very important criteria for the evaluation.
- Give meaningful id & class names for elements wherever required.
- Try to create reusable things.
- Add comments wherever possible to make the code more readable.	

Assume a Metacube Parking System. 
1. Create a landing page for the website of the above system as described. Create a navbar with navigation items. Add any covering image of your choice for the system. There will be 4 navigation items - 
    - Add Employee
    - Add Vehicle
    - Give feedback
    - Pricing
 
Below the image there will be 4 regions one after the other corresponding to the four navigation items. On click of each navigation item, the page should scroll automatically to the corresponding region (so that it can be used instantaneously) and works actually as a navigation item.

2. After the cover image of your choice, “employee” region should be added which consists of a form to enter the employee details with the following fields.
    - Full Name
    - Gender
    - Email Id
    - Password
    - Confirm Password
    - Contact Number
Use appropriate tags for the above defined fields according to their usage. Try to achieve basic validation using HTML only. No JS validations required.

3. After the “employee” region, “vehicle” region should be added which consists of a form to enter the employee details with the following fields.
    - Vehicle Make (Company)
    - Vehicle Model
    - Type
    - Vehicle Number
    - Employee Id
    - Identification (Textarea - Color, mark,visible accessory etc.)
Use appropriate tags for the above defined fields according to their usage. Try to achieve basic validation using HTML only. No JS validations required.

4. After the “vehicle” region, “feedback” region should be added. Create a feedback type form with fields of your choice. Sample feedback form can be like the image below. Only the HTML for the form is required with HTML validations.

5. After the “feedback” region, add a layout for pricing section resembling as shown in the below image for all the following vehicle types with format as Type(daily price, monthly price, yearly price) :- 
    - Cycle (5, 100, 500)
    - MotorCycle (10, 200, 1000)
    - Four Wheelers (20, 500, 3500)
Create such sections for all the three types one below the other in the “pricing” section.

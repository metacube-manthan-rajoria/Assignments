Question 2

Design a class “Search” to search for an element in an array using following strategy
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Each of the above methods will receive an array and an element to be search in array as input. It will return the index where this element occurs in array. Assume array to be sorted for Binary search.

Linear Search : Linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within an array. It sequentially checks each element of the array for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

Binary Search :  Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.

# Problem Statement
Design a class JobScheduler to simulate FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling algorithm. <br>
FCFS means the process which arrives first, gets executed first. 

Assume that we are receiving a number of processes with their arrival time and burst time seconds in a two dimensional array as input.  For example:

```
[0   ][10 ]
[6   ][20 ]
[60  ][10 ]
[110 ][5  ]
```

Define methods to perform following operations: 
- Calculate completion time for each process. 
- Calculate waiting time for each process.
- Calculate turn around time for each process.
- Average waiting time of processes.
- Maximum waiting time period for a process in queue.

# Problem Statement
Design a class HexCalc that supports following methods for hexadecimal arithmetic. 
You can assume that this class will be working with only positive integers.

- Methods to add, subtract, multiply and divide two hexadecimal numbers. 
- Each of the methods will receive hexadecimal numbers as strings, and will return the computed value as hexadecimal string. 
- The strategy that can be followed by each of the methods is to convert the strings into numbers, perform the computation, and reconvert the result back into hexadecimal representation.
- Methods to compare two hexadecimal numbers for ==, > and <. 
- Each of these methods will return a boolean value. 
- Implement these methods without converting the arguments to decimal numbers for comparison.
- Return the decimal representation of hexadecimal number.
- Return the hexadecimal representation of decimal number.

How would you generalise this to support arithmetic in any base?

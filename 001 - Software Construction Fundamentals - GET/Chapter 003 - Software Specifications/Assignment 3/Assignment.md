# Problem Statement
Design a class Area to calculate areas for different shapes. It should support following methods
- Method to return area of a Triangle. Method will receive width and height as double and return computed value as double.
- Method to return area of a Rectangle. Method will receive width and height as double and return computed value as double.
- Method to return area of a Square. Method will receive width as double and return computed value as double.
- Method to return area of a Circle. Method will receive radius as double and return computed value as double.

<br>
Assuming that height, width and radius will be greater than zero write proper specification for each method created above. Also assume that these methods may throw ArithmeticException.
